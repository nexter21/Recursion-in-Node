# Recursion in NodeJS with Cheerio JS

Here I have built a recursion function, which scrapes the name of all the trekking agencies registered in TAAN(Trekking Agencies Association Of Nepal)

## Install

```
$ node index

```

The above command will scrape all the agent names(A-Z) and save it in a file agents.txt
